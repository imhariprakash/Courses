<p>The <strong>CREATE TABLE</strong> statement is the most important command when making a database, depending on the DBMS you are using the options may vary heavily. In Postgres there are many things you can do with this statement.</p><p>We wanted to leave a couple of notes on the creation syntax!</p><h4>Normal tables</h4><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-07-17_15-45-18-6112c7a92b5ae3a444b5a7e6530ef26a.png"></figure><p>By default any time you run the <strong>CREATE TABLE</strong> command you will be creating an object in the public schema, unless otherwise specified. </p><p>Think of database design like drafting a blueprint for a house, and when you’re creating a table you’re drafting a blueprint for a specific room. What you put on that blueprint will determine how that room is going to look!</p><p>In our videos you saw us using this syntax to create many different tables with varying constraints, types and keys.</p><p>For the most part creating tables is the easy part, the hardest part is drafting the blueprint upfront so that you know what steps to follow. This is why database design and modelling is so crucial.</p><h4>Temporary tables</h4><p>One thing we did not touch on during these videos is the ability to create temporary tables. They are a type of table that exist in a special schema, so you cannot define a schema name when declaring a temporary table. </p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-07-17_15-24-57-b320b4e5ae1c6210cb6e8cb90c14d6ff.png"></figure><p>These types of tables will be dropped at the end of your session. It’s important to also note that they are only visible to the creator.</p><p>Now you may be wondering, why would I ever use these? Well if you’re writing intensive queries against a data set it might be beneficial to temporarily create a table based off another table. </p><p>This is because:</p><ul><li><p>	Temporary tables behave just like normal ones
</p></li><li><p>	Postgres will apply less “rules” (logging, transaction locking, etc.) to temporary tables so they execute more quickly
</p></li><li><p>	You have full access rights to the data, if you otherwise didn’t so you can test things out.
</p></li></ul>
