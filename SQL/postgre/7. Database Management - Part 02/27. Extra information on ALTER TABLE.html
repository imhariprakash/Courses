<p>ALTER&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;is a super powerful yet humble command, yes you heard me humble! I joke, but at the same time, this one command really has a large impact on your database. </p><p>As you saw throughout this section I used it to correct some mistakes, add some constraints, etc. but we really didn’t dive deeply into the power that lies dormant in this command.</p><p>You may be asking yourself why, but if I were to tell you every possible way you could apply this command there would be an endless amount of videos to supply for each use-case. Our main focus is to build your solid foundation and knowledge is power. Knowing how to apply this command is half the battle, knowing when and where to apply it, well that’s the fun puzzle that awaits you on your SQL journey!</p><h4>Syntax</h4><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-07-17_15-43-57-62351719b10b389a9a2c854219590124.png">As you can see in the above image, the image ALTER command has many things that it can change, from adding and removing columns to renaming them and changing their definition. However, there’s so much more you can do with it!</figure><ul><li><p>	Change the SCHEMA of a table</p></li><li><p>	Change the name of a table-level CONSTRAINT</p></li><li><p>	Add and remove constraints</p></li><li><p>	Change a column level constraint</p></li></ul><p>Our main advice when using this command is to make sure you communicate changes early and set in place a plan for other systems/software to be able to migrate, the last thing you want to happen is changing a column and suddenly all your services start breaking!</p>
